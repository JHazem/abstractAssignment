	 Sometimes it's better to use dynamic size arrays. 
	 Java's Arraylist can provide you this feature. 
	 Try to solve this problem using Arraylist.

	You are given  lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. 
	You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in  
	position of  line.
	
	Take your input from System.in.
	
	Input Format
	The first line has an integer . In each of the next  lines there will be an integer  
	denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be  space-separated 
	integers. In the next line there will be an integer  denoting number of queries. 
	Each query will consist of two integers  and .
	
	Constraints
	
	Each number will fit in signed integer.
	Total number of integers in  lines will not cross .
	
	Output Format
	In each line, output the number located in  position of  line. 
	If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"

	/* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-iterator/problem
	 
	 Java Iterator class can help you to iterate through every element in a collection. 
	 Here is a simple example:
		
		import java.util.*;
		public class Example{
		
		    public static void main(String []args){
		        ArrayList mylist = new ArrayList();
		        mylist.add("Hello");
		        mylist.add("Java");
		        mylist.add("4");
		        Iterator it = mylist.iterator();
		        while(it.hasNext()){
		            Object element = it.next();
		            System.out.println((String)element);
		        }
		    }
		}
		In this problem you need to complete a method func. 
		The method takes an ArrayList as input. 
		In that ArrayList there is one or more integer numbers, 
		then there is a special string "###", 
		after that there are one or more other strings.
		 A sample ArrayList may look like this:
		
		element[0]=>42
		element[1]=>10
		element[2]=>"###"
		element[3]=>"Hello"
		element[4]=>"Java"
		You have to modify the func method by editing at most 2 lines so that the code only prints the elements after the special string "###". For the sample above the output will be:
		
		Hello
		Java
		Note: The stdin doesn't contain the string "###", it is added in the main method.
		
		To restore the original code in the editor, 
		click the top left icon on the editor and create a new buffer.
